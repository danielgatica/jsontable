Subject: Performance Feedback Regarding Ramesh
I am writing to provide feedback regarding Ramesh's performance since joining our team a few months ago. During this time, he has primarily focused on analyzing existing implementations without direct client interaction.
One area of concern is Ramesh's readiness for client-facing responsibilities. We have communicated that his English proficiency requires improvement to ensure clear communication. Despite our suggestion that he reach out to team members before stand-ups to rehearse updates and refine his delivery, he has not taken this initiative. This has resulted in updates that lack clear business language, contain grammatical errors, and fail to properly capture assignment-related information as requested.
Additionally, Ramesh has demonstrated limitations in comprehending and following instructions. He was directed to first develop a high-level understanding of code functionality within the broader infrastructure before addressing specific implementation details. This approach was critical for effectively rectifying data, replicating implementation across platforms, and understanding data and exception handling logic. He was expected to deliver an action plan with potential ETAs, maintain progress documentation, track questions, and continuously validate his approach and analysis depth. However, Ramesh has not sought clarification on any instructions, proposed working sessions, provided execution plans, or created tracking documentation until repeatedly prompted. Similarly, documentation requested during Sriram's training and knowledge transfer sessions was never produced, reviewed, or maintained.
While Ramesh appears to possess some technical knowledge of our tools, there are significant gaps in his ability to capture requirements, understand scope, estimate effort, provide visibility into assignment status, and deliver clear updates demonstrating daily progress. I do not believe he is ready for client-facing responsibilities, and his continued presence on the team presents a risk due to the substantial time and effort required to repeatedly explain instructions, provide coverage, and reiterate directives. There is a concerning deficiency in his level of professional ownership and proactiveness when approaching assignments.
